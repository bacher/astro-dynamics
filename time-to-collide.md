> How to calculate the time required for 2 objects to collide by gravitation between them

To calculate the time required for two objects to collide due to their mutual gravitational attraction, you need to solve a two-body problem. This calculation assumes the objects start at rest and that no other forces are acting upon them. 

The gravitational force between the two objects increases as they get closer, which means their acceleration is not constant. Therefore, a simple kinematic equation cannot be used. The time to collision is a function of the initial separation distance, the masses of the two objects, and the universal gravitational constant.

## Step 1: Identify the variables

* T: The time to collision (in seconds).
* R: The initial distance between the centers of mass of the two objects (in meters).
* G: The universal gravitational constant, approximately \(6.674\times 10^{-11}\text{\ N}\cdot \text{m}^{2}/\text{kg}^{2}\).
* \(m_{1}\) and \(m_{2}\): The masses of the two objects (in kilograms).

## Step 2: Use the formula
The time to collision for two point masses starting at rest is given by the following formula, which is derived from the special case of a Keplerian orbit with zero eccentricity:

\(T=\frac{\pi }{2}\sqrt{\frac{R^{3}}{2G(m_{1}+m_{2})}}\)
